        <h3><i>By Monica Gomery</i></h3>
        <p>
          Whatever it was<br />
          I thought the end of my twenties<br />
          would amount to, I was wrong<br />
          about that. The end<br />
          of my twenties are about<br />
          death and the way death drapes<br />
          itself sparkling over our lives.<br />
          People are falling away<br />
          from us, people are peeling<br />
          and tumbling away.<br />
          The ground calls our names<br />
          in its sweet soil voice, the song<br />
          of our names rising up<br />
          from the ground like the smell<br />
          of hot bread lifting<br />
          out of its crust (â€¦).<br />
        </p>
